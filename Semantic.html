    <h1>First Part</h1>
<article>
    <section>
    <p>The section element creates a structure and document outline (semantic markup). It is similar to the div from HTML4,
    and represents a logical section or component of a web application or document. However, the div is a semantically
    neutral element, whereas the section element is not. The section element is exposed through the browser's
    accessibility Application Programming Interface (API).
    </p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Second Part</h2>
    <p>The section element can (in theory) be used with traditional HTML structural elements like heading elements to
    provide nested content. The theme of each section should be identified, typically by including a heading as a
    descendant of the section element (subject to caveats mentioned in USER AGENT NOTES).
    </p>   

    <h2>Second Part</h2>
    <p>The section element is a container for document content that has a related theme, and represents the section of a
    document that is grouped around a general concept. Everything within a section element is related. Also section
    elements may be nested if necessary. The section element is a generic semantic element, that can be used to combine
    portions of a document together into discrete units that are related in some way. For example, the section element
    may create items inside an outline of a document, or divide page content into related pieces (like an Introduction)
    followed by some background information on the topic.
    </p>  

    <h2>Second Part</h2>
    <p>Some examples of usage are given following. The section element can be applied to each individual section of a tab
    switcher or content slider (if an unordered list is not needed). The section element can also divide a lengthy
    "terms and conditions" (or similar) page into numbered sections. Furthermore, section elements can divide the
    different sections of a one-page website or portfolio. A common use offline could be to denote the chapter of a
    book.
    </p>

        <h3>Inside Part</h3>
        <p>The section element is appropriate only if the element's contents would be listed explicitly in the document's
            outline. When an element is needed only for styling purposes or as a convenience for scripting, authors are
            encouraged to use the div element instead. More specifically, use of the section element is not to be thought of as
            outlining content that needs to be styled visually in a particular way. If this is the case the author is advised to
            just use a semantically neutral div. Also, if the elements in the section cannot be described in one or two
            sentences, then section should not be used; div should be used instead.
